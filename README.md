Plover modifiers using # key

## Usage
Use the available web page to generate modifier dictionaries for use with Plover Stenography software.  This generator creates single and two-stroke definitions for virtually all modifiers (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Win).

## Why
I currently use a number system that does not use the # key to stroke numbers.  Therefore, I decided to use the # key to create much simpler modifiers for efficient OS navigation.

## Concerns
If you use the "normal" number system in Plover or Nimble Numbers, the single stroke dictionary will be virtually unusable.  However, the two stroke dictionary should word with minimal conflicts.  Note however I have not thoroughly tested this yet.
